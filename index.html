            <p>I was born in San Justo, Santa Fe, Argentina on February 10, 1986. A couple
                of years ago I’ve moved to Santa Fe City in Argentina.</p>
            <p>When I was younger I loved computers, many years ago I met the language C and
                created my first application. Then I met PHP and that’s when I discovered my
                real passion, being a web developer. Since then, I kept myself continuously
                learning and improving the way of writing better code, everyday.</p>
